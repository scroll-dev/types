## Usage

### Testing

`make test-chunk-prove` is the main testing entry point for the multi-level circuit constraint system of scroll-zkevm. Developers can understand how the system works by reading the codes of this test.

Besides, `make test-inner-prove` can be used to test the first-level circuit.

### Binaries

This repository is designed to be used as a Rust crate, rather than a standalone running process. However, you can still use the following command to run binaries locally.

Download setup params
```shell
make download-setup
```
Or specify degree and target directory to download
```shell
# As default `degree=25` and `params_dir=./prover/test_params`.
make download-setup -e degree=DEGREE params_dir=PARAMS_DIR
```

Prove
```shell
cargo build --release --bin prove

./target/release/prove --help
```
Or you can use it like the following:
```shell
cargo run --release --bin prove -- --params=./params --trace=./test.json
```

Verify
```shell
cargo build --release --bin verify

./target/release/verify --help
```

If you run into linking issues you may need to run
```shell
cp `find ./target/release/ | grep libzktrie.so` /usr/local/lib/
```
To move the zktrielib into a path where your linker could locate it.
